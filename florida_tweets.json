If the U.S. defaults on our debt, the entire global economy will be reduced to ashes. It would be a historic financial apocalypse. \n\nThe most disgusting part is that Republicans are only playing chicken with our lives because they want to pave the way for more tax cuts for the super rich — and hurt Biden politically in the process.\n\nThe GOP cuts would slash spending by an average of 18% and gut crucial programs like veterans' healthcare benefits. Simply put, the Republican demands will kill people.\n\nRetweet to call on Joe Biden to invoke the 14th Amendment to raise the debt ceiling without Republican help!",

It acts at the serotonin 5HT2A receptor in the brain- associated w schizophrenia & other mental illnesses, Mu opioid receptors-stimulating those & subsequent opioid use, dopamine receptor (fostering addiction - pot IS addictive) in addition to the cannabinoid receptors.

    "text": "This week #Florida Gov. Ron #DeSantis is set to officially announce his bid for the presidency. This comes amidst a growing conflict with one of the Sunshine State’s most prominent businesses – the Walt #Disney Company. The left claims DeSantis has picked a fight with the influential and iconic American entertainment entity. However, just as a brawl on the playground needs a teacher who insists on finding out how it started, it seems some clarity is in order.\n\nDeSantis is in the difficult position of being pro-business but anti-#woke Disney, so when it was revealed this week that the corporation would scrap plans for a new $1 billion campus in Lake Nona, FL, the left turned up the heat on the governor. This move would halt the creation of an estimated 2,000 jobs, and it is the second punch that CEO Bob #Iger has thrown at DeSantis. The first is a “free speech” lawsuit against the Florida governor, claiming that the appointment of the new oversight board is nothing more than a heavy-handed political ploy by an ambitious politician.\n\nWithout a beat, the leftist press burst into a litany of accusations against the governor: “Floridians are the losers here. We’ve lost jobs and investment, and we could lose even more, all because DeSantis picked a petty fight with Disney,” the Miami Herald’s editorial board opined. But is this merely a petty fight? And, more importantly, who started it?\n\nDisney Toying with Woke and Broke\n\nStepping back for a moment, it’s evident Disney is trying to climb out of serious financial issues of its own making. Certainly, Ron DeSantis wasn’t the genesis of Disney’s money problems. They were in such a tight spot the corporation canned its CEO and brought back Iger, who had retired in 2020. According to Brooke Barnes of The New York Times, Disney is beginning to crawl out from under its financial mess: “ $DIS said on Wednesday [May 10] that losses in its streaming business for the most recent quarter totaled $659 million, an improvement from a year earlier (and a vast improvement from the October-to-December period, when losses totaled $1.1 billion).”\n\nlibertynation.com/is-disney-…",

However, most refused to believe it:\n\nSecond, when you think you know the scope of how Machiavellian & corrupt the DC system is; reevaluate your reference, it’s way worse.\n\nRemember, there are trillions at stake, ‘trillions’.  With the geopolitical dynamic being threatened and with trillions of dollars at stake, nothing is ever off the table.\n\nWhen you think the people who control the world of finance and politics couldn’t possibly be organizing, coordinating and manipulating certain events, again, reevaluate your reference, because they do.\n\nIt’s a large network of aligned interests.  It does not take a lot of organization and/or the creation of some massive global conspiracy, to create outcomes of mutual benefit to all parties – when the interests of those parties are aligned inside the economics of the issue.  \n\nInstead, the process used has two components:\n\n(1) – Identify the common enemy. Thereby everyone can act according to their institutional interests to undermine and attack that enemy.\n\n(2) – Identify the common solution. Thereby, everyone can align to support the common objective according to their institutional capability.\n\nMaking accurate predictions simply falls into a process.  How will this [fill_in_blank] impact the global agents and the control agenda?   What will each element within the institutions do to support the removal of risk?  What will each element within the institutions of power do to align with a common solution?\n\nIf you follow that simple process logically, and if you accept things as they are – not as you would wish them to be, then predicting outcomes becomes a simple gathering of data points that highlight the alignment.   Predictions become a simple, if this – then that, analysis.\n\nGenerally speaking, when an inflection point is organized by the systems of power, such as a Ron DeSantis 2024 announcement, the traditional rulebook they follow instructs them to allow the introduced variable a full media cycle [36hour window] for the new narrative to settle as it dominates the news and public psyche.  After the full media cycle, the support operation begins.\n\nIf the traditional process is followed, and with Ron DeSantis making his announcement tomorrow, that puts the next indictment of President Trump on a schedule for Friday (ish).  \n\nI say “ish” because if the indictment people see positive value in the RdS rollout, they may delay a weekend media cycle.   So Friday or Monday, depending on how they view the success of the created inflection point.\n\nIt’s not a conspiracy folks, it’s just watching things as they are; reevaluating prior steps with new information, and ultimately knowing what to look for in the next logical sequence of events.\n\nMore soon….\"",
