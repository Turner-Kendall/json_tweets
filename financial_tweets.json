Instead, as Burry said, he took what he learned to form his own style.\n\nThis strategy works beyond just the world of investing.\n\nIt's said, for instance, that the filmmaker Quentin Tarantino knows so much about his filmmaking heroes that he could write their biographies.\n\n‚ÄúWhether it be Brian de Palma or Howard Marks or Douglas Sirk or Scorcese,‚Äù Tarantino explains, ‚ÄúI would just obsess about filmmakers the way a baseball fan might obsess about their favorite baseball players.‚Äù\n\nAnd yet, Tarantino movies are distinctly Tarantino‚Äîhe set out on his own path, and made Movies his way, by his own rules.\n\n- - -\n\n‚ÄúOne of the most critical factors in becoming a high performer is the degree to which your relationship to your pursuit stays in harmony with your unique disposition.‚Äù ‚Äî Josh Waitzkin\n\nFollow @bpoppenheimer for more content like this!",

He even begged for more of those sweet Patriot missile systems to help with their war effort. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Zelensky revealed that he's more comfortable dealing with Biden than Trump, and honestly, who can blame him?! Trump even claimed he could negotiate a peace settlement in Ukraine within 24 hours, but didn't seem to care that Ukraine's territory was illegally annexed under the previous administration.\n\nBut let's get back to the point: Zelensky is shook at the thought of a Republican-led government disrupting his war effort and, honestly, who wouldn't be? All that money, equipment and resources pouring into to Ukraine would no longer be necessary if President Donald J. Trump brokered a peace deal. Zelensky is just looking for more support and hopes to get it from the West before things go south. He's even said that they don't have enough Patriot missile systems to protect their frontline and civilians at the same time. So he‚Äôs out doing another media tour begging for more handouts from US instead of working on resolving the conflict. \n\nSo what do you think? Is Trump coming back to the White House in 2024?

We‚Äôre going to get some capital appreciation on top of the coupon clipping. I‚Äôm looking for close to double-digit returns on the Bloomberg aggregate over the next year.‚Äù\n\nThe chief investment officer for JPMorgan Investment Management Inc. said he sees opportunities in five-year Treasuries, given the ‚Äúbackup in yields.‚Äù He added that yields in the US investment-grade corporate bond market have once again attracted overseas investors.\n\nMichele reiterated his call to see 3% across the yield curve, which would represent a victory over inflation but a loss for the US economy. He warned against this cycle‚Äôs ‚Äúcash trap‚Äù effect.\n\n‚ÄúYou put money there and then a year from now it‚Äôs gone. Your cash run rate is probably below 4% a year from now. So you‚Äôve lost all of that, and then the yield curve starts to adjust to a central bank that‚Äôs cutting rates again,‚Äù he said.",

    "text": "üá∫üá∏üá∫üá¶‚ö°Ô∏è In February 2023, Zelensky met with the leadership of JP Morgan, one of the largest investment banks in the world. They discussed investments in the \"recovery\" of Ukraine.\n\nAs with the BlackRock fund, JP Morgan's activities in Ukraine are an effective scheme for appropriating state assets and exploiting them in the interests of Western states.\n\nBack in 2019, JP Morgan directly loaned the cash-strapped Ukrainian government about $350 million by purchasing the country's Eurobonds. \n\nNow the discussion revolves around the creation of an investment platform, which implies much larger investment volumes.\n\nIt's worth noting that the bonds are backed by state assets, which include infrastructure facilities, thermal power plants, nuclear power plants, agricultural and industrial enterprises.\n\nGiven the current state of the Ukrainian economy, it is impossible to repay the Ukrainian Eurobonds, and this is being exploited by major investors like JP Morgan. \n\nIf the Ukrainian government defaults on the Eurobonds, the state assets will be transferred to the ownership of the bank. This is a highly probable scenario since Ukraine's budget deficit is currently covered by IMF funds.\n\nAt the same time, the US private investment management company Vanguard Group is acquiring Ukrainian state assets under the guise of economic assistance to the Kiev regime.\n\nIn late April 2023, news began to emerge that the Ukrainian state company for oil and natural gas extraction, transportation, and processing, \"Naftogaz,\" was in negotiations with foreign giants Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Halliburton regarding the sale of its assets.\n\nAccording to the chairman of Naftogaz, Alexei Chernyshov, this will allow for increased extraction of energy resources and contribute to the replacement of Russian supplies to Europe in the coming years. \n\nHowever, he failed to mention that, as a result, control over the entire oil and gas sector of Ukraine will fall into the hands of these companies.\n\nDespite the appearance of competition, Chevron, ExxonMobil, and Halliburton are united by the financial company Vanguard, which holds the most shares in the three companies and effectively controls and directs their activities. \n\nAfter acquiring the assets of Ukrainian energy enterprises, Vanguard will become a monopolist in the country's oil and gas sector.\n\nVanguard is not the first to attempt to enter the Ukrainian market. From 2020 (when Zelensky signed a law opening the land market) to 2022, companies like Monsanto, Cargill, and Dupont, with Vanguard and BlackRock as key shareholders, have seized nearly 17 million hectares of arable land in Ukraine, accounting for approximately 52% of all agricultural land in the country.\n\nBefore and after 2014, Vanguard actively interacted with and sponsored radicals from the Azov Battalion and the Right Sector through Halliburton, which owns KBR, and Monsanto, which owns Academi (formerly Blackwater). These mercenaries are currently actively involved in combat operations on the side of Ukraine.\n\n1/2\n\n#rybar #ukrainewar #naftogaz #ukrainerussiawar #jpmorgan #monsanto #exxonmobil #chevron #blackrock #vanguard #zelensky #ukraine #halliburton #imf #fmi #wef #academi #blackwater",
